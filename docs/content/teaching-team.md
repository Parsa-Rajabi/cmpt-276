This term we will be using a [Slack](https://cmpt276-fall2023.slack.com) for all class discussions, including assignment clarifications!

When sending emails, do the following:

- Use your SFU email
- In the subject line, begin with "CMPT 276:" and then the topic of your message. For example, CMPT 276 D100: Missed Assignment 1.
- In the body of your message, include:
    - Your full name
    - Your SFU ID (typically your last name or initials with some numbers at the back)
    - Your 9-digit student number

This information is needed to help us respond more quickly. Missing any of the above might result in undelivered emails or delays in responses.

Note: Please do not send messages via the Canvas messaging system. The Canvas messaging system is not a communication avenue used in the course, and messages sent here may not be seen/responded to until much later.
